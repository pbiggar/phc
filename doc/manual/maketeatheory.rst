<para>
	:program:`maketea` is <ulink
	url="http://www.maketea.org">available separately</ulink> to |phc|. Based on
	a grammar definition of a language, it generates a C++ hierarchy for the
	corresponding abstract syntax tree, a tree transformation and visitor API,
	and deep cloning, deep equality and pattern matching on the AST. In this
	document we describe the grammar formalism used by |phc|, how a C++ class
	structure is derived from such a grammar, and explains how the tree
	transformation API is generated. The generated code itself is explained in
	<xref linkend="apioverview" endterm="apioverview.title">.

<title>The Grammar Formalism</title>

<para>
	The style of grammar formalism used by :program:`maketea` is
	sometimes referred to as an &ldquo;object oriented&rdquo; context free
	grammar.  It facilitates a trivial and reliable mapping between the grammar
	(<xref linkend="grammar">, and the actual (C++) abstract syntax tree (AST)
	that is generated by the |phc| parser.  
</para>

<para>
	We make a distinction between three types of symbols:
	<emphasis>non-terminal</emphasis> symbols, <emphasis>terminal
	symbols</emphasis> and <emphasis>markers</emphasis>.  Non-terminal symbols
	have the same function in our formalism as in the usual BNF formalism, and
	will not be further explained. We denote non-terminal symbols in lower case
	in the grammar (e.g., ``expr``).  
</para>

<para>
	The distinction between terminal symbols and markers is non-standard.
	Markers have no semantic value other than their presence; an example is
	``"abstract"``. Thus, the semantic value of a marker is a boolean
	value; it is either there, or it is not (note that this is different from a
	symbol such as the semi-colon, which has <emphasis>no</emphasis> semantic
	value whatsoever, and thus does not need to be included in an abstract
	syntax tree).  Conversely, the semantic value of a <emphasis>terminal
	symbol</emphasis> is an arbitrary value; an example is
	``CLASS_NAME`` (the structure of a terminal symbol may be defined
	by a regular expression; this is irrelevant as far as the abstract grammar
	is concerned). We denote markers in quotes (``"abstract"``), and
	terminal symbols in capitals (``CLASS_NAME``).  
</para>

<para>
	Each non-terminal symbol ``aa`` will have a single production in the
	grammar.  Instances of ``aa`` in the AST will be represented by a
	class called ``Aa``.  The attributes of ``Aa`` will
	depend on the production for ``aa`` (see below). 
</para>

<para>
	A terminal symbol ``xx`` will be represented by a class
	``XX``. Every token class gets an attribute called
	``value``. The type of this attribute depends on the token; for
	most tokens it is ``String*`` (this is the default); however, if
	the grammar explicitely specifies a type for the value (in angular brackets,
	for example ``REAL<double>``), this overrides the default. If
	the type of the ``value`` attribute it set to be empty, the token
	class does not get a value.
	</para>

<para>
	Finally, a marker will not be represented by a specialised class.  Instead,
	a marker ``"foo"`` may <emphasis>only</emphasis> appear as an
	optional symbol in a production rule (``a ::= ... "foo"? ...``),
	and will appear as a boolean attribute ``is_foo`` in the class
	representing ``aa`` (``Aa``).  
</para>

<para>
	There are only two types of rules in the grammar. The first is the simplest,
	and list a number of alternatives for a non-terminal symbol ``aa``:
</para>

.. sourcecode::

aa ::= b | c | ... | z


<!-- TODO: these can be Terminals too -->
<para>
	Here, each of ``b``, ``c``, ..., ``z`` must be a
	single non-terminal symbol.  This rule results in a (usually) empty
	``class Aa {}``, which acts as a superclass for the classes for
	``b``, ``c``, ..., ``z``. This reflects the
	semantics of the rule (a ``b`` <emphasis>is</emphasis> an
	``a``); if there are multiple rules ``aa ::= c|...``,
	``b ::= c|...``, class ``C`` will inherit from both
	``Aa`` and ``B``. This type of rule is exemplified
	by the production for ``Statement`` in the grammar. There is one
	additional requirement for disjunction rules, which will be explained in the
	section on context resolution, below.  
</para>

<para>
	The second type is the most common: 
</para>

.. sourcecode::

aa ::= b c ... z


<para>
	In this rule, each of the ``b``, ``c``, ...,
	``z`` is an arbitrary symbol (non-terminal, terminal or marker),
	which may be optional (``b?``) or repeated (``b*`` or
	``b+``). This type of rule must not include any disjunctions
	(``b|c``), and only single symbols can be repeated (no grouping).
	If a symbol ``b`` can be repeated, it will be represented by a
	specialised list class ``B_list`` (which inherits from the STL
	``list`` class) in the tree. In addition, the symbols may be
	labeled (``label:symbol``). This does not add to the grammar
	structure, but explains the purpose of the symbol in the rule, and will be
	used for the name of the attribute of the corresponding class.  The default
	name for each class attribute depends on the corresponding type: an
	attribute of type ``Variable_name``  (corresponding to a
	non-terminal ``Variable_name``) will be called
	``variable_name``. The default name for an attribute of type
	``Foo_list`` will be <emphasis>foos</emphasis>.  However, as
	mentioned above, this can be overridden by specifying a label.  
</para>

<para>
	As an example, consider the rule for ``variable`` in the grammar.
</para>

.. sourcecode::

Expr ::= ... | Variable | ... ;
Variable ::= Target? Variable_name <emphasis>array_indices</emphasis>:Expr?* ;


<para>
	A ``Variable`` is an ``Expr``, so that
	``Variable`` is represented by the class shown below.
</para>
<!-- TODO: I removed a discuss about optional attributes, since string_index
isnt supported in variable anymore. Does this need to be discussed? -->

.. sourcecode::

class Variable : virtual public Expr
{
public:
   Target* target;
   Variable_name* variable_name;
   Expr_list* array_indices;
}


<para>
	A final note on combining ``*`` and ``?``. The construct
	``(a*)?`` denotes an optional list of ``a``s. Thus, it
	will be represented by an ``A_list``. If a list is specified,
	but empty, the list will simply contain no elements. If the list is not
	specified at all, the list will be NULL. This is used, for example, to
	distinguish between methods that contain no statements and abstract methods.
	Similarly, ``(a?)*`` is a (non-optional) list of optional
	``a``s. Thus, this is a list, but elements of the list may be NULL.
	This is used for example to denote empty array indices (``a[]``) in
	the rule for ``Variable``.  
</para>

<title id="contextresolution.title">Context Resolution</title>

<para> We also derive the tree visitor API and tree transformation API from the
grammar. The tree visitor API is very simple to derive; see the <xref
linkend="apioverview" endterm="apioverview.title"> for an explanation. The
tree transformation API however is slightly more difficult to derive. The
problem is to decide the signatures for the transform methods, or in other
words, what can transform into what? For example, in the |phc| grammar for PHP,
the transform for an if-statement should be allowed return a list of statements
of any kind (because it is safe to replace an if-statement by a list of
statements).  Similarly, a binary operator should be allowed return any other
expression (but not a list of them). For reasons that will become clear very
soon, we call the process of deciding these signatures &ldquo;context
resolution&rdquo;. </para>

<section>

<title>Contexts</title>

<para>
	A context is essentially a use of a symbol somewhere in a (concrete) rule in
	the grammar.  There are four possibilities. Consider: 
</para>

.. sourcecode::

concrete1 ::= ... 
concrete2 ::= ...
concrete3 ::= ...
concrete4 ::= ...
concrete5 ::= ...
concrete6 ::= ...
abstract1 ::= concrete3 | concrete4
abstract2 ::= concrete5 | concrete6
	
some_concrete_rule ::= concrete1 concrete2* abstract1 abstract2* 


<para>
	then, based on the rule for some_concrete_rule, concrete1 occurs in the
	context (concrete1,concrete1,Single) - i.e., as a single instance of itself,
	concrete2 occurs in the context (concrete2,concrete2,List), i.e.  as a list
	of instances of itself. The use of the abstract1 class leads to a number of
	contexts: 
</para>

.. sourcecode::

(abstract1,abstract1,Single)
(concrete3,abstract1,Single)
(concrete4,abstract1,Single)


<para>
	And finally, the use of abstract2* yields to the contexts 
</para>

.. sourcecode::

(abstract2,abstract2,List)
(concrete5,abstract2,List)
(concrete6,abstract2,List)


<para>
	These contexts essentially mean that an instance of concrete5 can be
	replaced by any number of any (concrete) instance of "abstract2". 
</para>

</section>
<section>

<title>Reducing Contexts</title>

<para>
	If there are two or more conflicting contexts for a single symbol, we must
	resolve the contexts to their most specific (restrictive) form.  For
	instance, for the |phc| grammar, this yields 
</para>

.. sourcecode::

(if,statement,List)
(CLASS_NAME,CLASS_NAME,Single)
(INTERFACE_NAME,INTERFACE_NAME,Single)


<para>
	So, a context is a triplet (symbol,symbol,multiplicity), where the symbols
	are terminal or non-terminal symbols, and the multiplicity is either Single,
	Optional, List, OptionalList or ListOptional (list of optionals).  When
	reducing two contexts (``a``,``b``,``c``)
	(``a'``,``b'``,``c'``), we take the meet of
	``b`` and ``b'`` (that is, the most general common
	subclass of ``b`` and ``b'``, where more general means
	higher up in the inheritance hierarchy), and opt for the most restrictive
	Multiplicity (Single over Optional, Single over List, etc.). The general
	idea is that we want the most permissive context for a non-terminal that is
	still safe: if it is safe to replace an ``a`` by a list of
	``b``s <emphasis>everywhere</emphasis> in a tree, the context we
	want for ``a`` is (``a``, ``b``, list). 
</para>

<para>
	To see the reason for taking the meet, consider this fragment of the |phc|
	grammar:
</para>

.. sourcecode::

Expr ::= ... | BOOL
Cast ::= CAST Expr
Method_invocation ::= Target ...
Target ::= Expr | CLASS_NAME


<para>
	The use of "expr" in the rule for cast leads to the context
	(BOOL,expr,Single) The use of "target" in the rule for method_invocation
	leads to the context (BOOL,target,Single). By taking the meet of "expr" and
	"target", this gives the context (BOOL,expr,Single). This means that it is
	always safe to replace a boolean by any other expression (but it is not
	always safe to replace a boolean by any other <emphasis>target</emphasis>).
</para>
	
<para>
	In the case of CLASS_NAME, we have the contexts
</para>

.. sourcecode::

(CLASS_NAME,class_name,Single)
(CLASS_NAME,target,Single)


<para>
	The meet of class_name and target does not exist; hence this gives the
	context
</para>
	
.. sourcecode::

(CLASS_NAME,CLASS_NAME,Single)


<para>
	That is, the only safe transformation for CLASS_NAME is from CLASS_NAME to
	CLASS_NAME. 
</para>

<para>
	To be precise about the &ldquo;most specific&rdquo; multiplicity, here is a
	Haskell definition that returns the meet of two multiplicities:
</para>

.. sourcecode::

meet_mult :: Multiplicity -> Multiplicity -> Multiplicity
meet_mult a b | a == b = a
meet_mult Single _ = Single  
meet_mult List Optional = Single 
meet_mult List OptList = List
meet_mult List ListOpt = List
meet_mult Optional OptList = Single
meet_mult Optional ListOpt = Optional
meet_mult OptList ListOpt = List
meet_mult a b = meet_mult b a  <emphasis>-- meet is commutative</emphasis>


</section>
<section>

<title>Resolution for Disjunctions</title>

<para>
	We cannot deal with this situation:
</para>

.. sourcecode::

s ::= a
a ::= b | c
d ::= b
e ::= c*


<para>
	This grammar leads to the following contexts:
</para>

.. sourcecode::

(a,a,Single)
(b,a,Single)
(b,b,Single)
(c,a,Single)
(c,c,List)


<para>
	Resolving these contexts lead to
</para>

.. sourcecode::

(a,a,Single)
(b,b,Single)
(c,c,List)


<para>
	However, this is incorrect, because this indicates that an ``a``
	will only be replaced by another, single, ``a``; but a
	``c`` (which is an ``a``) will in fact return a list of
	``c``s. The problem is that the non-terminals in the rule for
	``a`` have a different multiplicity in their contexts (single for
	``b``, list for ``c``). :program:`maketea`
	disallows this; if this happens in a grammar,
	:program:`maketea` will exit with a &ldquo;cannot deal with
	mixed multiplicity in disjunction&rdquo; error.
</para>

<para>
	Otherwise, for a rule ``a ::= b1 | b2 | ...``, if the multiplicity
	of ``a`` is list, and the multiplicities of all the ``b``s
	are lists, the multiplicity for ``a`` will be list; if the
	multiplicity of all the ``b``s is single, the multiplicity for
	``a`` will be set to single (independent of the original
	multiplicity for ``a``).
</para>
