phc's documentation now uses sphinx. On Debian/Ubuntu, install the
python-sphinx package (note, we use features of sphinx 0.6.x. At time of
writing, this wasn't in ubuntu, so use 'easy_install sphinx' instead.

There were previous failed experiments with latex and docbook, the latter being
too cumbersome to use in practice.

To make html documentation (which gets output in the .build directory), use
	$ make html

To make pdf documentation, use:
	$ make latex
and follow the instructions.


The .sgml files will be removed once we verify that nothing is lost in their
conversion to reST (or sooner, if that never happens). They can be built with:
	jade -t sgml -d manual.dsl#html manual.sgml


Writing documentation:
	Some defintions are in include.rst, so include that in every document.

	A TODO list is maintained at the bottom of manual.rst.

	Use the following conventions for section headings.

		* > with overline, for top-level
		* & with overline, for books
		* # with overline, for parts
		* * with overline, for chapters
		* =, for sections
		* -, for subsections
		* ^, for subsubsections
		* ", for paragraphs
