<para> Now that we have seen in <xref linkend="treetutorial1"> how to inspect
the tree, in this tutorial we will look at modifying the tree. The task we set
ourselves is: replace all calls to <code>mysql_connect</code> by calls to
<code>dbx_connect</code> (<ulink
url="http://pecl.php.net/package/dbx">dbx</ulink> is a PECL extension to PHP
that allows scripts interface with a database independent of the type of the
database; this conversion could be part of a larger refactoring process that
makes a script written for MySQL work with other databases.) </para>

<para> The tutorial we develop in this tutorial is available as
<filename>MySQL2DBX.la</filename> in the &phc distribution. To see its effect,
run &phc as follows: </para>
	
<programlisting>
phc --run plugins/tutorials/MySQL2DBX.la --pretty-print test.php
</programlisting>

<title>First Attempt</title>

<para> As in the previous tutorial, we are interested in all function calls.
However, now we are interested only in function calls to
<code>mysql_connect</code>. Let us have a look at the precise definition of a
function call according to the <xref linkend="grammar" endterm="grammar.title">:
</para>

<programlisting>
method_invocation ::= target method_name <emphasis>params:</emphasis>actual_parameter* ;
method_name ::= METHOD_NAME | reflection ;
actual_parameter ::= <emphasis>is_ref:</emphasis>"&"? expr ;
</programlisting>
			
<para> (The <code>target</code> of a method invocation is the class or object
the function gets invoked on. It is explained in <xref
linkend="treetutorial3">, and need not worry us here.) For now, we are only
interested in the <code>method_name</code>. The grammar tells us that a
<code>method_name</code> is either a <code>METHOD_NAME</code> or an
<code>expr</code>. If a symbol is written in CAPITALS in the grammar, that
means it refers to a &ldquo;code&rdquo;. In this case, to an actual method name
(such as <code>mysql_connect</code>). In PHP, it is also possible to call a
method whose name is stored in variable; in this case, the function name will
be a <code>reflection</code> node (which contains an <code>expr</code>). In
this tutorial, we are interested in &ldquo;normal&rdquo; method invocations
only. </para>

<para> Literals (or &ldquo;<emphasis>terminal symbols</emphasis>&rdquo;) do not
get represented by a class called <code>AST_something</code>, but by a class
called <code>Token_something</code> instead. All classes
<code>Token_something</code> have an attribute called <code>value</code> which
corresponds to the value of the token. For most tokens, the type of
<code>value</code> is an STL <code>String*</code>. However, for some tokens,
for example <code>INT</code>, <code>value</code> has a different type (e.g.,
<code>int</code>). If the token has a non-standard type, it will have an
additional attribute called <code>source_rep</code>, which corresponds to the
representation of the token in the source. For example, the real number
<code>5E-1</code> would have <code>value</code> equal to the
(<code>double</code>) 0.5, but <code>source_rep</code> equal to (the
<code>String*</code>) &ldquo;5E-1&rdquo;. </para> 

<para> Thus, we arrive at the following first attempt. </para>

<programlisting>
<reserved>#include</reserved> &lt;phc/Tree_visitor.h&gt;

<reserved>class</reserved> MySQL2DBX : <reserved>public</reserved> Tree_visitor
{
<reserved>public</reserved>:
   <reserved>void</reserved> post_method_invocation(AST_method_invocation* in)
   {
      Token_method_name* name;
	  
      name = <reserved>new</reserved> Token_method_name(<reserved>new</reserved> String("mysql_connect"));
      <reserved>if</reserved>(in-&gt;method_name-&gt;match(name))
      {
         in-&gt;method_name = <reserved>new</reserved> Token_method_name(<reserved>new</reserved> String("dbx_connect"));
      }
   }
};

<reserved>extern</reserved> "C" <reserved>void</reserved> process_ast(AST_php_script* php_script)
{
   MySQL2DBX m2d;
   php_script-&gt;visit(&amp;m2d);
}
</programlisting>

<para> <reserved>Note</reserved>: &phc uses a garbage collector, so there is
never any need to free objects (you never have to call <code>delete</code>).
This makes programming much easier and less error-prone (smaller chance of
bugs). </para>

<para> <code>match</code> compares two (sub)trees for deep equality.  There is
also another function called <code>deep_equals</code>, which does nearly the
same thing, but there are two important differences.  <code>match</code> does
not take comments, line numbers and other &ldquo;additional&rdquo; information
into account, whereas <code>deep_equals</code> does. The second difference is
that <code>match</code> supports wildcards; this will be explained in <xref
linkend="treetutorial3">.

<title>Modifying the Parameters</title>

<para> Unfortunately, renaming <code>mysql_connect</code> to
<code>dbx_connect</code> is not sufficient, because the parameters to the two
functions differ. According to the <ulink
url="http://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php">PHP manual</ulink>, the signatures
for both functions are </para>

<programlisting>
mysql_connect (server, username, password, new_link, int client_flags)
</programlisting>

<para> and </para>

<programlisting>
dbx_connect (module, host, database, username, password, persistent)
</programlisting>

<para> The <code>module</code> parameter to <code>dbx_connect</code> should be
set to <code>DBX_MYSQL</code> to connect to a MySQL database. Then
<code>host</code> corresponds to <code>server</code>, and <code>username</code>
and <code>password</code> have the same purpose too. So, we should insert
<code>DBX_MYSQL</code> at the front of the list, and insert <code>NULL</code>
in between <code>host</code> and <code>username</code> (the
<code>mysql_connect</code> command does not select a database). The last two
parameters to <code>mysql_connect</code> do not have an equivalent in
<code>dbx_connect</code>, so if they are specified, we cannot perform the
conversion. The last parameter to <code>dbx_connect</code>
(<code>persistent</code>) is optional, and we will ignore it in this tutorial.
</para>

<para> Now, in &phc, <code>DBX_MYSQL</code> is an <code>AST_constant</code>.
Because &phc deals with everything as being classes, a constant must also be
defined in a class. Constants defined in the PHP standard library, such as
<code>DBX_MYSQL</code>, should be defined in the special &ldquo;class&rdquo;
<code>%STDLIB%</code>. (For more information on how PHP gets converted to the
abstract syntax tree, see <xref linkend="representingphp"
endterm="representingphp.title">.) <para> Finally, <code>NULL</code> is
represented by <code>Token_null</code>.  </para>

<para> We are now ready to write our conversion function: </para>

<programlisting>
#include &lt;phc/Tree_visitor.h&gt;

<reserved>class</reserved> MySQL2DBX : <reserved>public</reserved> Tree_visitor

<reserved>public</reserved>:
   <reserved>void</reserved> post_method_invocation(AST_method_invocation* in)
   {
      AST_actual_parameter_list::iterator pos;
      Token_constant_name* module_name;
      AST_constant* module_constant;
      AST_actual_parameter* param;
      Token_method_name* name;
	  
      name = <reserved>new</reserved> Token_method_name(<reserved>new</reserved> String("mysql_connect"));
      <reserved>if</reserved>(in-&gt;method_name-&gt;match(name))
      {
         <emphasis>// Check for too many parameters</emphasis>

         {
            printf("Error: unable to translate call "
               "to mysql_connect on line %d\n", in-&gt;get_line_number());
            <reserved>return</reserved>;
         }
      
         <emphasis>// Modify name</emphasis>
         in-&gt;method_name = <reserved>new</reserved> Token_method_name(<reserved>new</reserved> String("dbx_connect"));
      
         <emphasis>// Modify parameters</emphasis>
         module_name = <reserved>new</reserved> Token_constant_name(<reserved>new</reserved> String("DBX_MYSQL"));
         module_constant = <reserved>new</reserved> AST_constant("%STDLIB%", module_name);
         
         pos = in-&gt;actual_parameters-&gt;begin();
         param = <reserved>new</reserved> AST_actual_parameter(false, module_constant);
         in-&gt;actual_parameters-&gt;insert(pos, param); pos++;
         <emphasis>/* Skip host */</emphasis> pos++;
         Token_null* null = <reserved>new</reserved> Token_null(<reserved>new</reserved> String("NULL"));
         param = <reserved>new</reserved> AST_actual_parameter(false, null);
         in-&gt;actual_parameters-&gt;insert(pos, param); 
      }
   }
};

<reserved>extern</reserved> "C" <reserved>void</reserved> process_ast(AST_php_script* php_script)
{
   MySQL2DBX m2d;
   php_script-&gt;visit(&amp;m2d);
}
</programlisting>

<para> If we apply this transformation to </para>

<programlisting>
$link = mysql_connect('host', 'user', 'pass');
</programlisting>

<para> We get </para>

<programlisting>
$link = dbx_connect(DBX_MYSQL, "host", NULL, "user", "pass");
</programlisting>

<title>Refactoring</title>

<para> A quick note on refactoring. Refactoring is the process of modifying
existing programs (PHP scripts), usually to work in new projects or in
different setups (for example, with a different database engine). Manual
refactoring is laborious and error-prone, so tool-support is a must. Although
&phc can be used to refactor PHP code as shown in this tutorial, a dedicated
refactoring tool for PHP would be easier to use (though of course less
flexible). Such a tool can however be built on top of &phc;. See also the list
of <ulink url="http://www.phpcompiler.org/spinoffs">Spinoff Projects</ulink> on
the &phc website. </para>
