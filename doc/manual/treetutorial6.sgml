<para> In this tutorial we will develop step-by-step a transform that expands
<code>include</code> statements. For example, if <filename>b.php</filename> is
</para>

<programlisting>
&lt;?<reserved>php</reserved>
   echo "Hello world";
?&gt;
</programlisting>
			
<para>and <filename>a.php</filename> is</para> 

<programlisting>
&lt;?<reserved>php</reserved>
   include "b.php";
   echo "Goodbye!";
?&gt;
</programlisting>

<para>Then running the transform on <filename>a.php</filename> yields </para>

<programlisting>
&lt;?<reserved>php</reserved>
   echo "Hello world\n";
   echo "Goodbye\n";
?&gt;
</programlisting>

<para> The transform we will develop in this tutorial is only a simple
implementation of <code>include</code>s, and we won't take every feature of
<code>include</code> into account. However, it can serve as a basis for more
full-featured version. The transform we will develop here is available as
<filename>plugins/tutorials/Expand_includes.la</filename>. </para>

</section>
<section>

<title> Deleting Nodes </title>

<para> Our transform should process <code>include</code> statements.
In the AST, <code>include</code>s are represented as method
invocations. Thus, we might start like this: </para>

<programlisting>
<reserved>class</reserved> Expand_includes : <reserved>public</reserved> AST_transform
{
<reserved>public</reserved>:
   AST_expr* pre_method_invocation(AST_method_invocation* in)
   {
      <emphasis>// Process includes</emphasis>
   }
};
</programlisting>

<para> However, this will not get us very far. The return type of
<code>pre_method_invocation</code> is an <code>AST_expr</code>.
That means that we can replace the method invocation (the
<code>include</code> statement) only by another, single,
expression. But we want to replace it by the contents of the
specified file! </para>

<para> Recall from <xref linkend="treetutorial1"> that to
turn an expression into a statement, &phc 
inserts an <code>AST_eval_expr</code> in the abstract syntax tree.
Thus, if we want to process <code>include</code> statements, we
could also look at all <code>eval_expr</code> nodes. Assuming for
the moment we can make that work, does it get us any further? As a
matter of fact, it does! If you check
<filename>&lt;AST_transform.h&gt;</filename>, you will see that the 
signature for <code>pre_eval_expr</code> is </para>

<programlisting>
<reserved>void</reserved> pre_eval_expr(AST_eval_expr* in, List&lt;AST_statement*&gt;* out)
</programlisting>

<para> This is different from the signatures we have seen so far. For
nodes that can be replaced by a number of new nodes, the pre transform
and post transform methods will not have a return value in their
signature, but have an extra <code>List&lt;xxx&gt;</code> argument.
This list is initialised to be empty before
<code>pre_eval_expr</code> is invoked, and when
<code>pre_eval_expr</code> returns, the nodes in this list will
replace <code>*in</code>. If the list is empty, the node is simply
deleted from the tree. </para>

<para> So, we will use the following plugin as our starting point.
Executing this plugin deletes all <code>eval_expr</code> nodes from
the tree (try it!). </para>

<programlisting>
<reserved>#include</reserved> "AST_transform.h"

<reserved>class</reserved> Expand_includes : <reserved>public</reserved> AST_transform
{
<reserved>public</reserved>:
   <reserved>void</reserved> pre_eval_expr(AST_eval_expr* in, List&lt;AST_statement*&gt;* out)
   {
   }
};

<reserved>extern</reserved> "C" <reserved>void</reserved> process_ast(AST_php_script* php_script)
{
   Expand_includes einc;
   php_script-&gt;transform_children(&amp;einc);
}
</programlisting>

<section>

<title> Using the XML unparser </title>

<para> So, we now want to do something more useful than deleting all
<code>eval_expr</code> nodes from the tree. The first thing we need
to be able to do is distinguish <code>include</code> statements
from other <code>eval_expr</code> nodes. We can use pattern
matching (see <xref linkend="treetutorial3"> and <xref linkend="treetutorial4"> 
) to do that - but what should we match
against? If you are unsure about the structure of the tree, it can
be quite useful to use the XML unparser to find out what the tree
looks like. We modify the plugin as follows: </para>

<programlisting>
<reserved>#include</reserved> "AST_transform.h"
<reserved>#include</reserved> "process_ast/XML_unparser.h"

<reserved>class</reserved> Expand_includes : <reserved>public</reserved> AST_transform
{
<reserved>private</reserved>:
   XML_unparser* xml_unparser;

<reserved>public</reserved>:
   Expand_includes()
   {
      <emphasis>// Send output to cout, do not print attributes</emphasis>
      xml_unparser = <reserved>new</reserved> XML_unparser(cout, false);
   }

<reserved>public</reserved>:
   <reserved>void</reserved> pre_eval_expr(AST_eval_expr* in, List&lt;AST_statement*&gt;* out)
   {
      in-&gt;visit(xml_unparser);
   }
};
</programlisting>

<para> The XML unparser is implemented using the
<code>AST_visitor</code> API, so it can be invoked just like you
run any other visitor. There is a similar visitor called
<code>PHP_unparser</code> (in
<filename>&lt;process_ast/PHP_unparser.h&gt;</filename>) that you can use
to print (parts of the) AST to PHP syntax. </para>

<para> When you run this transform on <filename>a.php</filename>, it will print
two <code>eval_expr</code> nodes (shown in XML syntax), one for the
<code>include</code> and one for the <code>echo</code> . We are
interested in the first, the <code>include</code>: 
</para>

<programlisting>
&lt;AST_eval_expr&gt;
   &lt;AST_method_invocation&gt;
      &lt;AST_target xsi:nil="true" /&gt;
      &lt;Token_method_name&gt;
         &lt;value&gt;include&lt;/value&gt;
      &lt;/Token_method_name&gt;
      &lt;AST_actual_parameter_list&gt;
         &lt;AST_actual_parameter&gt;
            &lt;bool&gt;&lt;!-- is_ref --&gt;false&lt;/bool&gt;
            &lt;Token_string&gt;
               &lt;value&gt;b.php&lt;/value&gt;
               &lt;source_rep&gt;b.php&lt;/source_rep&gt;
            &lt;/Token_string&gt;
         &lt;/AST_actual_parameter&gt;
      &lt;/AST_actual_parameter_list&gt;
   &lt;/AST_method_invocation&gt;
&lt;/AST_eval_expr&gt;
</programlisting>

<para> This tells us that the <code>include</code> statement is an
<code>eval_expr</code> node (that was obvious from the fact that we implemented
<code>pre_eval_expr</code>). The <code>eval_expr</code> contains a
<code>method_invocation</code> (we knew that too, although of course a node of
type <code>eval_expr</code> can contain any type of expression). The method
invocation has target <code>NULL</code> (it is not invoked on an object or a
class), method name &ldquo;<code>include</code>&rdquo;, and a single parameter
in the parameter list that contains the name of the file we are interested in.
We can construct a pattern that matches this tree exactly: </para>

<programlisting>
<reserved>class</reserved> Expand_includes : <reserved>public</reserved> AST_transform
{
<reserved>private</reserved>:
   Wildcard&lt;Token_string&gt;* filename;
   AST_method_invocation* pattern;

<reserved>public</reserved>:
   Expand_includes()
   {
      filename = <reserved>new</reserved> Wildcard&lt;Token_string&gt;;
      pattern = 
         <reserved>new</reserved> AST_method_invocation(
            NULL,
            <reserved>new</reserved> Token_method_name(<reserved>new</reserved> String("include")),
            <reserved>new</reserved> List&lt;AST_actual_parameter*&gt;(
               <reserved>new</reserved> AST_actual_parameter(false, filename)
            )
         );
   }

<reserved>public</reserved>:
   <reserved>void</reserved> pre_eval_expr(AST_eval_expr* in, List&lt;AST_statement*&gt;* out)
   {
      <emphasis>// Check for calls to include</emphasis>
      <reserved>if</reserved>(in-&gt;expr-&gt;match(pattern))
      {
         <emphasis>// Matched! Try to parse the file</emphasis>
      }
      <reserved>else</reserved>
      {
         <emphasis>// No match; leave untouched</emphasis>
         out-&gt;push_back(in);
      }
   }
};
</programlisting>
	
<para> Note how the construction of the pattern follows the structure
of the tree as output by the XML unparser exactly. The only
difference is that we leave the actual filename a wildcard;
obviously, we want to be able to match against any
<code>include</code>, not just <code>include("a.php")</code>.
Running this transform should remove the <code>include</code> from
the file, but leave the other statements untouched (note that we
need to <code>push_back in</code> to <code>out</code> to make sure
a statement does not get deleted). </para>

</section>
<section>

<title> The Full Transform </title>

<para> We are nearly done! All that's left is to parse the file (we can use the
&ldquo;<code>filename</code>&rdquo; wildcard to find out while file we need to
include) and inserts all statements in the parsed file at the point of the
include. Parsing PHP is hard, but of course &phc; comes with a PHP parser. To
use this parser, include the <filename>&lt;parsing/parse.h&gt;</filename>
header and call &ldquo;<code>parse</code>&rdquo;.  Here then is the full
transform: </para>  

<programlisting>
<reserved>#include</reserved> "AST_transform.h"
<reserved>#include</reserved> "parsing/parse.h"
<reserved>#include</reserved> "process_ast/XML_unparser.h"

<reserved>class</reserved> Expand_includes : <reserved>public</reserved> AST_transform
{
<reserved>private</reserved>:
   XML_unparser* xml_unparser;
   Wildcard&lt;Token_string&gt;* filename;
   AST_method_invocation* pattern;

<reserved>public</reserved>:
   Expand_includes()
   {
      xml_unparser = <reserved>new</reserved> XML_unparser(cout, false);

      filename = <reserved>new</reserved> Wildcard&lt;Token_string&gt;;
      pattern = 
         <reserved>new</reserved> AST_method_invocation(
            NULL,
            <reserved>new</reserved> Token_method_name(<reserved>new</reserved> String("include")),
            <reserved>new</reserved> List&lt;AST_actual_parameter*&gt;(
               <reserved>new</reserved> AST_actual_parameter(false, filename)
            )
         );
   }

<reserved>public</reserved>:
   <reserved>void</reserved> pre_eval_expr(AST_eval_expr* in, List&lt;AST_statement*&gt;* out)
   {
      // in-&gt;visit(xml_unparser);

      <emphasis>// Check for calls to include</emphasis>
      <reserved>if</reserved>(in-&gt;expr-&gt;match(pattern))
      {
         <emphasis>// Matched! Try to parse the file</emphasis>
         AST_php_script* php_script = parse(filename-&gt;value-&gt;value, NULL, false);
         <reserved>if</reserved>(php_script == NULL)
         {
            cerr 
            &lt;&lt; "Could not parse file " &lt;&lt; *filename-&gt;value-&gt;value
            &lt;&lt; " on line " &lt;&lt; in-&gt;get_line_number() &lt;&lt; endl;
            exit(-1);
         }

         <emphasis>// Replace the include by the statements in the parsed file</emphasis>
         out-&gt;push_back_all(php_script-&gt;statements);
      }
      <reserved>else</reserved>
      {
         <emphasis>// No match; leave untouched</emphasis>
         out-&gt;push_back(in);
      }
   }
};

<reserved>extern</reserved> "C" <reserved>void</reserved> process_ast(AST_php_script* php_script)
{
   Expand_includes einc;
   php_script-&gt;transform_children(&amp;einc);
}
</programlisting>

<para> <emphasis>Exercise.</emphasis> One problem with the plugin we have
developed is that if the file we are including in turn has <code>include</code>
statements, they will not be processed. Modify the plugin to invoke the
transform on the list of statements from the parsed file, taking care to deal
with infinite loops (if the first file includes the second, and the second the
first). </para>
