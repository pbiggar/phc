		       The ocaml-event library

Overview

  Ocaml-Expat is a wrapper for the libevent API. The libevent API
  provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific
  event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been
  reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to signals
  or regular timeouts. Libevent is meant to replace the event loop
  found in event driven network servers. An application just needs to
  call event_dispatch() and then adds or removes events dynamically
  without having to change the event loop. This wrapper makes the
  libevent library available for ocaml programmers.

Installation

  - Download, compile, and install libevent. 
    See http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

  - Edit the variables at the beginning of the Makefile to reflect the
    location where libevent is installed on your system. 

  - Do make depend; make all	

  - If the Objective Caml native-code compiler is available on your
    platform (look for the "ocamlopt" executable), do "make allopt".

  - To generate the documentation, do "make doc"

  - (Optional) To test the library, do "make test". This requires the
    installation of OUnit.

  - (Optional) To test the library compiled with ocamlopt and ocamlc,
    do "make testall". This requires the installation of OUnit.

  - Become super-user if necessary and do "make install".  This
    installs the library in the standard Objective Caml library
    directory.
