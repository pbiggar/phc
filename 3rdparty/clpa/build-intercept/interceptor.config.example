# Build interception configuration file

[Paths]
# All the paths must be absolute paths.
#
# intercept_scripts should be the build-intercept/ subdirectory of your clpa
# tree.
# intercept_library should point to 'libintercept.so' (usually in the same 
# directory).
# intercept_home can be anywhere where the interceptor can dump stuff. I 
# recommend not on a network directory.
intercept_home=/export/sc1/bhackett/build
intercept_scripts=/afs/cs.stanford.edu/u/bhackett/clpa/build-intercept
intercept_library=/afs/cs.stanford.edu/u/bhackett/clpa/build-intercept/libintercept.so

[Redirections]
# Each entry in the redirections section specifies a diversion that should
# happen during the build process. The left hand side is a POSIX regular 
# expression that is matched against the absolute path to each binary that 
# is executed. If the regular expression matches then the script on the
# right hand side is executed instead. Usually each script does something 
# and then calls the original program.
# The right hand side of each redirection is taken relative to the 
# intercept_scripts directory.
# If multiple regular expressions match, then the first matching redirection
# will be used.
