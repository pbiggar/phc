(** Specialized to integer keys by George Necula *)

(** Association tables over ordered types.

   This module implements applicative association tables, also known as
   finite maps or dictionaries, given a total ordering function
   over the keys.
   All operations over maps are purely applicative (no side-effects).
   The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and therefore searching
   and insertion take time logarithmic in the size of the map. 
*)

type (+'a) t
      (** The type of maps from type [key] to type ['a]. *)

val empty: 'a t
    (** The empty map. *)

val is_empty: 'a t -> bool
    (** Test whether a map is empty or not. *)

val add: int -> 'a -> 'a t -> 'a t
    (** [add x y m] returns a map containing the same bindings as
       [m], plus a binding of [x] to [y]. If [x] was already bound
       in [m], its previous binding disappears. *)

val find: int -> 'a t -> 'a
    (** [find x m] returns the current binding of [x] in [m],
       or raises [Not_found] if no such binding exists. *)

val remove: int -> 'a t -> 'a t
    (** [remove x m] returns a map containing the same bindings as
       [m], except for [x] which is unbound in the returned map. *)

val mem: int -> 'a t -> bool
    (** [mem x m] returns [true] if [m] contains a binding for [x],
       and [false] otherwise. *)

val iter: (int -> 'a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit
    (** [iter f m] applies [f] to all bindings in map [m].
       [f] receives the key as first argument, and the associated value
       as second argument.  The bindings are passed to [f] in increasing
       order with respect to the ordering over the type of the keys.
       Only current bindings are presented to [f]:
       bindings hidden by more recent bindings are not passed to [f]. *)

val map: ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t
    (** [map f m] returns a map with same domain as [m], where the
       associated value [a] of all bindings of [m] has been
       replaced by the result of the application of [f] to [a].
       The bindings are passed to [f] in increasing order
       with respect to the ordering over the type of the keys. *)

val mapi: (int -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t
    (** Same as {!Map.S.map}, but the function receives as arguments both the
       key and the associated value for each binding of the map. *)

val fold: (int -> 'a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b -> 'b
    (** [fold f m a] computes [(f kN dN ... (f k1 d1 a)...)],
       where [k1 ... kN] are the keys of all bindings in [m]
       (in increasing order), and [d1 ... dN] are the associated data. *)

val compare: ('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a t -> 'a t -> int
    (** Total ordering between maps.  The first argument is a total ordering
        used to compare data associated with equal keys in the two maps. *)

val equal: ('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a t -> 'a t -> bool
    (** [equal cmp m1 m2] tests whether the maps [m1] and [m2] are
       equal, that is, contain equal keys and associate them with
       equal data.  [cmp] is the equality predicate used to compare
       the data associated with the keys. *)
