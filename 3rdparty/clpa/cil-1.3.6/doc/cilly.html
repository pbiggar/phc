<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc6">5</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;How to Use CIL</H2><P><A NAME="sec-cil"></A></P><P>There are two predominant ways to use CIL to write a program analysis or
transformation. The first is to phrase your analysis as a module that is
called by our existing driver. The second is to use CIL as a stand-alone
library. We highly recommend that you use <TT>cilly</TT>, our driver. </P><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="toc2"></A><A NAME="htoc7">5.1</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Using <TT>cilly</TT>, the CIL driver</H3><P>The most common way to use CIL is to write an Ocaml module containing your
analysis and transformation, which you then link into our boilerplate
driver application called <TT>cilly</TT>. <TT>cilly</TT> is a Perl script that
processes and mimics <TT>GCC</TT> and <TT>MSVC</TT> command-line arguments and then
calls <TT>cilly.byte.exe</TT> or <TT>cilly.asm.exe</TT> (CIL's Ocaml executable). </P><P>An example of such module is <TT>logwrites.ml</TT>, a transformation that is
distributed with CIL and whose purpose is to instrument code to print the
addresses of memory locations being written. (We plan to release a
C-language interface to CIL so that you can write your analyses in C
instead of Ocaml.) See Section&#XA0;<A HREF="ext.html#sec-Extension">8</A> for a survey of other example
modules. </P><P>Assuming that you have written <TT>/home/necula/logwrites.ml</TT>, 
here is how you use it: </P><OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Modify <TT>logwrites.ml</TT> so that it includes a CIL &#X201C;feature
descriptor&#X201D; like this: 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">let feature : featureDescr = 
  { fd_name = "logwrites";              
    fd_enabled = ref false;
    fd_description = "generation of code to log memory writes";
    fd_extraopt = [];
    fd_doit = 
    (function (f: file) -&gt; 
      let lwVisitor = new logWriteVisitor in
      visitCilFileSameGlobals lwVisitor f)
  } 
</PRE>The <TT>fd_name</TT> field names the feature and its associated
command-line arguments. The <TT>fd_enabled</TT> field is a <TT>bool ref</TT>.
&#X201C;<TT>fd_doit</TT>&#X201D; will be invoked if <TT>!fd_enabled</TT> is true after
argument parsing, so initialize the ref cell to true if you want
this feature to be enabled by default.<P>When the user passes the <TT>--dologwrites</TT>
command-line option to <TT>cilly</TT>, the variable associated with the
<TT>fd_enabled</TT> flag is set and the <TT>fd_doit</TT> function is called
on the <TT>Cil.file</TT> that represents the merger (see Section&#XA0;<A HREF="merger.html#sec-merger">13</A>) of
all C files listed as arguments. </P></LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Invoke <TT>configure</TT> with the arguments
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">./configure EXTRASRCDIRS=/home/necula EXTRAFEATURES=logwrites
</PRE><P>This step works if each feature is packaged into its own ML file, and the
name of the entry point in the file is <TT>feature</TT>.</P><P>An alternative way to specify the new features is to change the build files
yourself, as explained below. You'll need to use this method if a single
feature is split across multiple files.</P><OL CLASS="enumerate" type=a><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
Put <TT>logwrites.ml</TT> in the <TT>src</TT> or <TT>src/ext</TT> directory. This
will make sure that <TT>make</TT> can find it. If you want to put it in some
other directory, modify <TT>Makefile.in</TT> and add to <TT>SOURCEDIRS</TT> your
directory. Alternately, you can create a symlink from <TT>src</TT> or
<TT>src/ext</TT> to your file.</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Modify the <TT>Makefile.in</TT> and add your module to the 
<TT>CILLY_MODULES</TT> or
<TT>CILLY_LIBRARY_MODULES</TT> variables. The order of the modules matters. Add
your modules somewhere after <TT>cil</TT> and before <TT>main</TT>.</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">If you have any helper files for your module, add those to
the makefile in the same way. e.g.:<PRE CLASS="verbatim">CILLY_MODULES = $(CILLY_LIBRARY_MODULES) \
                myutilities1 myutilities2 logwrites \
                main
</PRE><P>Again, order is important: <TT>myutilities2.ml</TT> will be able to refer
to Myutilities1 but not Logwrites. If you have any ocamllex or ocamlyacc
files, add them to both <TT>CILLY_MODULES</TT> and either <TT>MLLS</TT> or
<TT>MLYS</TT>.</P></LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Modify <TT>main.ml</TT> so that your new feature descriptor appears in
the global list of CIL features. 
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">let features : C.featureDescr list = 
  [ Logcalls.feature;
    Oneret.feature;    
    Heapify.feature1;  
    Heapify.feature2;
    makeCFGFeature; 
    Partial.feature;
    Simplemem.feature;
    Logwrites.feature;  (* add this line to include the logwrites feature! *)
  ] 
  @ Feature_config.features 
</PRE><P>Features are processed in the order they appear on this list. Put
your feature last on the list if you plan to run any of CIL's
built-in features (such as makeCFGfeature) before your own.</P></LI></OL><P>Standard code in <TT>cilly</TT> takes care of adding command-line arguments,
printing the description, and calling your function automatically. 
Note: do not worry about introducing new bugs into CIL by adding a single
line to the feature list. </P></LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">Now you can invoke the <TT>cilly</TT> application on a preprocessed file, or
instead use the <TT>cilly</TT> driver which provides a convenient compiler-like
interface to <TT>cilly</TT>. See Section&#XA0;<A HREF="cil007.html#sec-driver">7</A> for details using <TT>cilly</TT>.
Remember to enable your analysis by passing the right argument (e.g.,
<TT>--dologwrites</TT>). </LI></OL><H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="toc3"></A><A NAME="htoc8">5.2</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Using CIL as a library</H3><P>CIL can also be built as a library that is called from your stand-alone
application. Add <TT>cil/src</TT>, <TT>cil/src/frontc</TT>, <TT>cil/obj/x86_LINUX</TT>
(or <TT>cil/obj/x86_WIN32</TT>) to your Ocaml project <TT>-I</TT> include paths.
Building CIL will also build the library <TT>cil/obj/*/cil.cma</TT> (or
<TT>cil/obj/*/cil.cmxa</TT>). You can then link your application against that
library. </P><P>You can call the <TT>Frontc.parse: string -&gt; unit -&gt; Cil.file</TT> function with
the name of a file containing the output of the C preprocessor.
The <TT>Mergecil.merge: Cil.file list -&gt; string -&gt; Cil.file</TT> function merges
multiple files. You can then invoke your analysis function on the resulting
<TT>Cil.file</TT> data structure. You might want to call
<TT>Rmtmps.removeUnusedTemps</TT> first to clean up the prototypes and variables
that are not used. Then you can call the function <TT>Cil.dumpFile:
cilPrinter -&gt; out_channel -&gt; Cil.file -&gt; unit</TT> to print the file to a
given output channel. A good <TT>cilPrinter</TT> to use is
<TT>defaultCilPrinter</TT>. </P><P>Check out <TT>src/main.ml</TT> and <TT>bin/cilly</TT> for other good ideas
about high-level file processing. Again, we highly recommend that you just
our <TT>cilly</TT> driver so that you can avoid spending time re-inventing the
wheel to provide drop-in support for standard <TT>makefile</TT>s. </P><P>Here is a concrete example of compiling and linking your project against
CIL. Imagine that your program analysis or transformation is contained in
the single file <TT>main.ml</TT>. </P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">$ ocamlopt -c -I $(CIL)/obj/x86_LINUX/ main.ml
$ ocamlopt -ccopt -L$(CIL)/obj/x86_LINUX/ -o main unix.cmxa str.cmxa \ 
        $(CIL)/obj/x86_LINUX/cil.cmxa main.cmx
</PRE><P>The first line compiles your analysis, the second line links it against CIL
(as a library) and the Ocaml Unix library. For more information about
compiling and linking Ocaml programs, see the Ocaml home page
at <A HREF="javascript:loadTop('http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/')">http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/</A>. </P><P>In the next section we give an overview of the API that you can use
to write your analysis and transformation. </P><HR>
