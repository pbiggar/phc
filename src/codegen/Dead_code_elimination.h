 * The lowering passes introduce a lot of unnecessary copies, which
 * add extra reference counts, resulting in extra copying and poor
 * performance.
 *
 * This removes assignments from simple variables to compiler-generated
 * temporaries, so long as the temporary is never used.
 *
 * HACK TODO: Remove.
 * This is exactly the sort of hacky thing we wanted
 * to remove. This would be much better done with a data-flow
 * framework, but is much easier than cleaning up the passes, which
 * would otherwise be necessary.
